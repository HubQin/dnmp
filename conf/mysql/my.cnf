# Optimized my.cnf configuration for MySQL/MariaSQL
#
# by Fotis Evangelou, developer of Engintron (engintron.com)
#
# === Updated December 2018 ===
#
# The settings provided below are a starting point for a 2GB - 4GB RAM server with 2-4 CPU cores.
# If you have less or more resources available you should adjust accordingly to save CPU,
# RAM and disk I/O usage.
# The settings marked with a specific comment or the word "UPD" after the value
# should be adjusted for your system by using database diagnostics tools like:
# https://github.com/major/MySQLTuner-perl
# or
# https://launchpad.net/mysql-tuning-primer (supports MySQL up to v5.6)
#
#
# Note that if there is NO comment after a setting value, then 99,9% of the times you won't need to adjust it.
#
#
# THINGS TO DO AFTER YOU UPDATE MY.CNF - TROUBLESHOOTING
# If any terminal commands are mentioned, make sure you execute them as "root" user.
# If MySQL cannot start or restart, then perform the following actions.
#
# 1. If the server had the stock database configuration and you added or updated any
#    "innodb_log_*" settings (as suggested below), then execute these commands ONLY
#    the first time you apply this configuration:
#
#    $ rm -rvf /var/lib/mysql/ib_logfile*
#    $ chown -R mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql
#    $ service mysql restart
#
#    or use the shorthand command:
#    $ rm -rvf /var/lib/mysql/ib_logfile*; chown -R mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql; service mysql restart
#
# 2. If the setting "bind-address" is not commented out, then make sure the file /etc/hosts is
#    properly configured. A good example of a "clean" /etc/hosts file is something like this:
#
#    127.0.0.1 localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
#    ::1       localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6
#    1.2.3.4   hostname.domain.tld hostname # Replace accordingly!
#
#    Finally restart the database service:
#
#    $ service mysql restart
#
# 3. If the database service cannot restart even after the first 2 steps, make sure the database data folder
#    (common for either MySQL or MariaDB) "/var/lib/mysql" is owned by the "mysql" user AND group.
#    Additionally, the folder itself can have 0751 or 0755 file permissions. To fix it, simply do this:
#    $ chown -R mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql
#    $ chmod 0755 /var/lib/mysql
#
#    Finally restart the database service:
#
#    $ service mysql restart
